# Hisam's Personal Website v2

This website was built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). The overall design was heavily inspired by the websites of [Maxime Bonhome's](https://bonhomme.lol/) and [Emil Kowalski's](https://emilkowal.ski/)

## Developing

Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
