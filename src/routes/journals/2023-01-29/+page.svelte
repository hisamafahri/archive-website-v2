	<h3 class="head-section">A new start(?)</h3>
	<p>
		While I have been hiatus of writing for the past few months, I think I've found my spirit again
		of writing. And along with my brand new website (that you are currently looking at right now),
		it will be a great new start, a new reset of my writing journey.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">Why?</h3>
	<p>
		Heart surely can change overtime. But in my case, I think I have enough things that I put in my
		personal (physical) journal that I write everyday, and I need to share it to the world. Not
		much, and not really sure wheter it'll be helpful or not, but I just need to do it anyway.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">What it'll be</h3>
	<p>
		If you ask me what my journals will be, my answer is: "It'll be a mess". My intention is to put
		as many things as possible, as often as possible. It might be a technical articles, it might be
		some random thoughts of mine, it can be anything.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		While it might be worthless, I think having a habit to write down anything can surely be a great
		assets of mine. Not just in <a
