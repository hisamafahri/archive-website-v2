	<h3 class="head-section">A new start(?)</h3>
	<p>
		While I have been hiatus of writing for the past few months, I think I've
		found my spirit again of writing. Along with my brand new website (that you
		are currently looking at right now), it will be a great new start, a new
		reset of my writing journey.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">Why?</h3>
	<p>
		Heart surely can change over time. But in my case, I think I have enough
		things that I put in my personal (physical) journal that I write every day,
		and I need to share it with the world. Not much, and not sure whether it'll
		be helpful or not, but I just need to do it anyway.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">What it'll be</h3>
	<p>
		If you ask me what my journals will be, my answer is: "It'll be a mess". My
		intention is to put as many things as possible, as often as possible. It
		might be technical articles, it might be some random thoughts of mine, it
		can be anything.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		While it might be worthless, I think having a habit of writing down anything
		can surely be a great asset of mine. Not just in my <a

		>.
