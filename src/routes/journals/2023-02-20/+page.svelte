	<h3 class="head-section">The story</h3>
	<p>
		As a <a href="https://neovim.org" target="_blank">NeoVim</a> users, I have been "asked" why on earth
		I use NeoVim for my daily driver for building products and doing some general programming. I've given
		a lot of various answers over time, start from boasting about the performance benefits, the flex
		of not touch my mouse, and so on.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		But over the time, as I grown my understanding, as I widen my view of this world, I have found
		few key reasons that I might think are why I keep sticking on using NeoVim.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I'd like to make this journals as my go to answer if in the future some peoples are asking me
		why I do the way I do. Not because I don't want to answering them. But, I'd like to give them
		the most thorough, clear, and concise answers possible.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">I "own" it</h3>
	<p>
		I my self am not the creator of Vim or NeoVim, I am not that old (sorry, Bram✌️). But, since
		NeoVim itself, after the installation, will only gives you the bare minimum things (like really
		minimum), I have to add some plugins, configure it, and manage it to be able to use it as I want
		to be.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>I think the last sentences are speaks a lot: <i>... as I want it to be</i>.</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Building, configuring, and managing my tools, that as a Software Engineer use in your day-to-day
		life makes me always feels excited everytime I open my terminal and spins up my NeoVim. It
		always prompt me to ask my self: <i>"Ah, what should I code today?"</i>.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		My setups are so personalised for me that's why it is called as a "Personalised Development
		Environment".
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">It prompts me to learn more</h3>
	<p>
		I've never heard about <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol"
			target="_blank">LSP</a
		> before, but I have to configure the LSP on my own editor.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I've never heard about <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"
			target="_blank">AST</a
		>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing" target="_blank">parser</a> or any other cool computer
		science terms before. But I have to be at least have some grasps on them in order to understand how
		my editor works.
	</p>

	<h3 class="head-section">it's fun</h3>
	<p>
		i personally realised that building your pde is requires time and energy. i can gives you all of
		the technical advantages and try to convince you to join the bandwagon. but, if you ask me to
		why i keep doing this, is because it is fun for me.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I can spend my night just to choose the best colorscheme that suits my need and liking. <i
			>It was fun.</i
		>
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I can spend some time on figuring out the best key-bindings for my frequent tasks. <i
			>It was fun</i
		>.
	</p>
	<h3 class="head-section">Should you try?</h3>
	<p>
		Yes! But, in the end I realised that the meost important thing is that you enjoy what you do. If
		you think you much more comfortable working in Visual Studio Code, in IntelliJ, or anything else
		(even Notepad), go for it.
